# Sketchy "GenieTalk" Clone App

So the Github legend that is Annalu Waller (she has a GitHub coat for crying out loud) has a paper with Per Ola and Tom Griffiths on genieTalk - the output of ACE-LP. Its long awaited. I wanted to play with it and couldnt. So I asked a coding agent to make it for me. 

So IP/Licence/credits are all TOTALLY to Annalu, Per Ola and Tom Griffiths. And a credit to the augmentcode.com app/VS Code.. Its mad you can make this stuff without looking at a line of code.
